Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It's designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. You are probably familiar with Markup languages like HTML, but Markdown is different because it's designed to be easy to read and write, even when not converted to HTML.

You might have ran into Markdown and markdown like syntax before. For example, Reddit.com uses Markdown for formatting comments. You can also use Markdown in many other places like GitHub, GitLab, and Discord.
