# Hosting Options

## Overview

When it comes to hosting options, there are a few different options to choose from. The most popular options are Netlify, Amazon S3, and GitHub Pages. Each of these options has their own pros and cons, but I think it's important to understand the differences between them.

## Netlify

Netlify is a popular hosting platform for scalable sites and applications. Netlify offers a range of features and tools to help developers and teams build, deploy, and manage their sites efficiently, including continuous deployment, global edge caching, serverless functions, and more.

> Note: I personally use Netlify for my Jamstack sites. Read more about my experience with Netlify in my [Netlify Overview](/en/netlify/).

## Amazon S3

Amazon S3 is a cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon S3 allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web. Amazon S3 is highly scalable, reliable, and secure, and it offers a range of features and tools to help you manage and access your data efficiently. Some of the key features of Amazon S3 include data durability, data security, and data management.

## GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a free hosting service provided by GitHub. GitHub Pages allows you to host your static website or web application on GitHub's servers. GitHub Pages is easy to use and allows you to quickly and easily publish your site or app, and it integrates seamlessly with the rest of GitHub's tools and features. GitHub Pages also offers free SSL certificates and automatic HTTPS to secure your site.

## Who else?

There are a few other options for hosting static sites, but I think these are the most popular options. If you're interested in contributing to this guide, please feel free to add more information about other hosting options.

When choosing a hosting option, it's important to consider your specific needs and requirements. If you are building a Jamstack site, Netlify is a great option because it offers a range of features and tools specifically designed for Jamstack sites. If you need a scalable and reliable cloud storage solution, Amazon S3 is a good choice. And if you want to host a static website or web app on GitHub, GitHub Pages is a convenient and easy-to-use option.
