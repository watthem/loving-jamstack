# Introduction

Welcome! Today, I'm thinking about two popular static site generatorsâ€”Jekyll and Hugo.

The great part of both frameworks is you can build a website from scratch without writing a single line of code. All you need to do is create Markdown files for your content, and then use HTML templates to structure your pages. Both tools also supports themes for added features, so you can customize your site to fit your needs.

Both Jekyll and Hugo are great options for quickly creating static sites. They each have unique features that make them a great choice for developers and non-developers alike. However, Hugo is also known for its fast build times, so you can quickly update your website in seconds. While Jekyll is a bit slower, it's still a great option for creating a static site and has been around for a long time.

## Meet Jekyll

Created in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Jekyll is a static site generator written in the Ruby programming language. It is designed to make it easier for developers to create static sites quickly, without having to write out code from scratch. Jekyll is known for its easy-to-use workflow and its ability to build a website from a combination of Markdown files and HTML templates.

Hugo is a much newer static site generator, having been released in 2013. Written in the Go programming language, Hugo is known for its speed, simplicity, and ease of use.

Hugo is a great choice for those who want to quickly spin up a static site without the need for complex coding.
