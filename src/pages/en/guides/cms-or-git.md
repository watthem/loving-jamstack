## Introduction

You may be wondering whether you should use a CMS or Git for your content management. Or maybe you are not sure what a CMS is, let alone git. This guide will help you understand the pros and cons of using a CMS vs Git for content management and will help you decide which is best for you.

> Note: Some refer to the use of CMS as "headless CMS" or "decoupled CMS". This is because the CMS is decoupled from the frontend. The frontend is built with a static site generator (SSG) like Eleventy, Gatsby, Gridsome, Hugo, Jekyll, Nuxt, VuePress, etc. And the CMS is used to manage the content, while the SSG transforms the content into a static site.

There many ways you can approach content management when building for Jamstack.

- CMS e.g., WordPress, Contentful, DatoCMS, Forestry, NetlifyCMS, Prismic, Sanity, Strapi, etc.
