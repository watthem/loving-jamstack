This is my digital garden. I'm documenting my journey of learning Jamstack, Web Development, and more.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A [digital garden](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up) is a place where you can grow your thoughts. It's a place where you can document your journey of learning and where you can share your journey with others.

## What is Jamstack?

Jamstack is a modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup.

- [Hosting Options](/en/hosting-options/)

## Why am I documenting my journey publicly?

I'm documenting my journey because I thought it was the best way to explore the Jamstack space and I want to share my journey with others. I also want to help others learn (and I want to help others learn how to learn).

- Check out the [guides](/en/guides/) for information on various Jamstack topics.
- My [tutorials](/en/tutorials/) are used for more hands-on learning
- Or if you're new to web development, check out for a list of resources for learning [Git](/en/git-resources/) and [Markdown](/en/markdown-resources/).
