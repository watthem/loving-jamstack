## History of Static Hosting

- Static hosting is not new idea
- The idea of static hosting is to host static files on a server

## JAMStack Frameworks

As far as their features and capabilities, it's unfair to directly compare these frameworks because they are all very different. However, I think it's important to review them together because they are all very popular at certain junctures in the last few years. They all have their own strengths and weaknesses that can be grouped into similar categories.
