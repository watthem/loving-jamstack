## Overview

Jamstack frameworks are a collection of tools that allow you to build a static website. They are a combination of a static site generator, a bundler, and a deployment tool. The static site generator is responsible for taking your content and transforming it into HTML. The bundler is responsible for taking your static assets and transforming them into a format that can be served by a CDN. The deployment tool is responsible for taking your static site and deploying it to a CDN.

> Static site generators (SSG) are _"A tool which can be run as part of a build to transform content, data, and templates into files which can be deployed to a hosting environment as a ready-to-serve web site."_ â€” Check out more at [jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org/glossary/ssg/).

## History of Static Hosting

Static hosting is not new idea
The idea of static hosting is to host static files on a server instead of running a full application on the server. This approach is simpler and more secure than traditional dynamic hosting

The term "static hosting" was first used in the late 1990s

Static hosting has become increasingly popular in recent years as web development practices have evolved.

## Jamstack Frameworks

As far as their features and capabilities, it's unfair to directly compare these frameworks because they are all very different. However, I think it's important to review them together because they are all very popular at certain junctures in the last few years. They all have their own strengths and weaknesses that can be grouped into similar categories.

## Hosting and Deployment

The beautiful thing about Jamstack is that you can host your site anywhere. You can host your site on a CDN, a server, or even a static file hosting service like Netlify or Vercel. The only requirement is that your site is static. This means that you're working with built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. You're not working with a server-side language like PHP or Ruby or even a database like MySQL or MongoDB. WordPress is a common example of a server-side application. It's a content management system that uses a database to store content and a server-side language to render the content into HTML. This is a very different approach than Jamstack.

### What does the bundler do?

A bundler takes a collection of files that are bundled together, and helps you to transform them into a format that can be served by a network. Kinda like a zip file.

Webpack is an example of bundler that takes your JavaScript files and bundles them together into a single file that can be served by a CDN. Some newer bundlers like Vite and Snowpack are able to bundle your JavaScript files without needing to bundle your CSS and HTML files.

### What's the deployment tool?

- Deployment tools are tools that allow you to deploy your static site to a CDN. Some examples of deployment tools are Netlify, Vercel, and Cloudflare Pages.
