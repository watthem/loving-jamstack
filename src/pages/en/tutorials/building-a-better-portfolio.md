## Introduction

A portfolio is an essential tool for anyone looking to showcase their skills and experience. You may already have a portfolio hosted on something like WordPress, Wix, or Squarespace. Or maybe you rolled your own custom e.g., JS Express, Ruby on Rails or Flask app.

Whether you are looking for a job or trying to attract new clients, having a well-crafted, easy-to-update, SEO-friendly portfolio is essential. In this guide, we will discuss why Jamstack is a great choice for building a better portfolio.

## Overview

Following the thought process of building a portfolio website using [Jamstack framework of your choice](/en/jamstack-frameworks), we'll be using the following technologies:

- [Markdown](/en/markdown-resources) for content
- [Git](/en/git-resources) for deployment
- [Netlify](/en/netlify) for hosting

## Why use Jamstack for your portfolio?

Most out-of-the-box platforms are not ideal for a portfolio because they are not optimized for performance. You often have to manage content through some sort of white-label CMS which is not ideal for many reasons:

- security is a concern (hi wordpress botnets) ü§ñ
- you are limited into a platform üöâ
- you are locked in what you can do with your content üîè

And forget about SEO! You can't control the meta tags, the page titles, or sometimes even the content itself. You are at the mercy of the plugins.

### Jamstack is a better choice

Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs and Markup) offers a great way to build a modern portfolio. It provides the advantage of being able to build a portfolio quickly and easily, while also providing a secure and reliable platform for showcasing your work. Additionally, Jamstack allows you to create a portfolio that is highly optimized for SEO, making it easier for potential employers and clients to find you.

Even if you prefer the look and feel of a traditional CMS, Jamstack offers a great way to build a portfolio that is easy to update and maintain.

### You are in control

You can use a classic generator like [Jekyll or Hugo](../guides/jekyll-and-hugo) to make a blazingly fast build times, or a GraphQL powered static site generator like [Gatsby or Gridsome](../guides/gatsby-and-gridsome) to pull in data from many sources, then host it on a platform like Netlify. This allows you to use a traditional CMS like WordPress or Squarespace to manage your content, while still having the benefits of a Jamstack site.

Another advantage of using Jamstack is that it allows you to take advantage of modern web technologies such as React, Vue, and SolidJS. These frameworks are incredibly powerful for creating highly interactive and engaging websites. Additionally, they can be used to create beautiful, responsive designs that look great on any device.

Overall, Jamstack provides the perfect platform for creating a modern portfolio that stands out from the crowd. It is fast, secure, and easy to use, making it ideal for showcasing your work in the best light.

## Picking a framework

When it comes to building a portfolio, it is important to choose a framework that is easy to use and provides the features you need. There are many different frameworks available, so it is important to do your research and find one that is right for you.

### Classicly trained

Two of the oldest and most popular static site generators are [Jekyll and Hugo](jekyll-and-hugo). These frameworks are great for building a portfolio because they are easy to use and provide a wide range of features. They also have a large community of developers who can help you with any problems you may encounter. They are built with Ruby and Go, which are both popular programming languages. When it comes to using these tools, you don't need to know much about either language to get started.

### Javascript powered

If you are comfortable with Javascript on its own, you may find static site generators like Metalsmith or Eleventy of interest. These frameworks allow you to build a portfolio using only Javascript, which makes them ideal for developers who are not familiar with other languages.

But there are many different frameworks based on popular JavaScript frameworks.

### Javascript Framework...frameworks

React and Vue are two of the most popular frameworks for building modern websites, and both are great choices.

React is a powerful and versatile JavaScript library that is used to create high-performance user interfaces. It is easy to learn and has a wide range of components and tools to create stunning websites. Additionally, React has great documentation and a vibrant community of developers.

Vue is another popular framework for creating modern websites. It is lightweight and easy to use, and has great documentation and a supportive community. Vue also offers a wide range of components and tools to help you create beautiful and interactive websites.

Both React and Vue are great choices for building a portfolio, so it is important to do some research and find the one that best suits your needs.

- [Docusaurus and VuePress](/en/guides/docusarus-and-vuepress) - for documentation related features
- [Gatsby and Gridsome](/en/gatsby-and-gridsome) - for custom UI components and routing

### Notable

There's so many frameworks out there, it's hard to keep track of them all. Here are some notable ones that we've seen used for portfolios:

- [Astro](https://Astro.build) is an interesting framework since it allows you to combine the power of React with the simplicity of Vue. It is a great choice for developers who want to build a portfolio using both React and Vue, but don't want to commit to one or the other.
- [MetalSmith](https://metalsmith.io/) is a powerful and versatile static site generator that is built on top of Node.js. It is easy to learn and has a wide range of components and tools to create stunning websites. Additionally, MetalSmith has great documentation and a vibrant community of developers.
